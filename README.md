# Hand-Sign-detection
This project is a real-time hand sign detection system using OpenCV, cvzone, and TensorFlow. It captures webcam video, detects a hand, crops and resizes it to a fixed 300×300 white background, and prepares it for gesture classification. The system can also collect and save images for building a custom hand sign dataset.
